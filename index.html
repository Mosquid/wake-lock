    <h2>How To Keep Computer From Sleeping When You Are Not Actively Using It</h2>
    <p>There is a tiny video (~11KB) &darr; playing in the background and preventing your laptop from sleeping.</p>
    <p>Just keep this page open in your browser and your laptop stays awake without you touching a keyboard or mouse.</p>
    <p><strong>Wake Lock</strong> &mdash; is a handy feature in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to make sure your uploading/downloading will not get interrupted by your laptop going to sleep.</li>
      <li>You want to focus on reading a long article on your second screen, and not being annoyed of your laptop screen dims.</li>
      <li>Any other time-consuming operations that require your laptop to remain on.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Very soon there will be added a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet" target="_blank">bookmarklet</a> allowing you to keep your laptop awake, no matter what site you are on.</p>
